INTERROBANG: a tiny launcher menu packing a big bang (syntax)

Interrobang is a launcher menu somewhat similar to dmenu.  Interrobang has two unique features:

1) Tab completion for both commands and filename parameters (use bash completion or the new companion completer "percontation")

2) A "bang syntax" inspired by the duckduckgo search engine.

User defined bangs, and the look/feel of interrobang can be customized in ~/.interrobangrc.  A template for this file is available in this repo, but it is not installed with the Makefile or PKGBUILD - you must copy it manually, or just use it as a template for your own.

Interrobang is new and under active development.  This page will be udpated periodically, but for the most up to date information, see here:
